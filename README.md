# AEM 6 Developer Certification Reviewer

## Introduction

I want to create a quiz application to help our team in reviewing for the [AEM 6 Developer Certification Exam](https://training.adobe.com/certification/exams/aem_6_0_developer.html). Since we are using React in our projects already, I thought of creating the app with React.

There are 10 questions included in the source code, some of those are from the AEM 6 Developer sample exam.

This repo is a study of both how React works with Webpack and of the Materialize CSS framework. Initial code is from https://github.com/gchandrasa/quiz-react

## Tech

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)


## Installation
